# PokeAPP introduction
This project is a personal project that utilizes the PokeAPI to create a simple Angular application for learning purposes. It demonstrates how to fetch and display data from the PokeAPI, showcasing various Angular features such as components, services, and routing.This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.15.

# Getting Started
## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
